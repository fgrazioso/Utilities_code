those three scripts are part of (old) microfluidic grooves python Deep Learning code.

In particular, this code was used in an old situation, where (with Keras) I was able to train only the "old version" of microfluidic images, without the orange tint.
So this scripts were used to preprocess the images, and transform the hue and the contrast, to make them similar to the one used for the training.
